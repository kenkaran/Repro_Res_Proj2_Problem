     701  nado A9. The first area overlapped the Grady/McClain County line and extended to about 3 miles north
     801  west of Newcastle, ending just west of the 16th St. overpass on Interstate 44, while the other area
     901  was observed 2 miles northwest of Newcastle. Thirty-eight homes and 2 businesses were destroyed in M
    1001  cClain County, and 40 homes were damaged. Damage then diminished to F2 intensity as the tornado cros
    1101  sed the South Canadian River into northern Cleveland County. 1160

468425    The tornado entered Cleveland County between Portland and May and between SW 164th and SW 179th in s
     101  outh Oklahoma City. Damage was rated F2 in this area with a path width averaging 1/2 of a mile. The
     201  first major housing development to be struck in Cleveland County was Country Place Estates located j
     301  ust west of Pennsylvania Ave. where about 50 homes were damaged, with 1 dozen of these homes receivi
     401  ng F4 damage. One slab home was cleanly swept from its foundation, and several vehicles were picked
     501  up from the subdivision and tossed across Pennsylvania Ave, a distance of approximately 1/4 of a mil
     601  e. One vehicle was found under a bridge just east of the intersection of Pennsylvania and SW 134th.
     701  This particular area of damage has been rated high F4/low F5. Oklahoma City Police indicated that pa
     801  rt of an airplane wing, believed to have originated from Chickasha Municipal Airport in Grady County
     901  , landed in this area. The tornado then tracked through Eastlake Estates, a densely populated housin
    1001  g development, located north of SW 134th and between Pennsylvania and Western, where 3 fatalities oc
    1101  curred. Entire rows of homes were virtually flattened to piles of rubble. Four adjacent homes on one
    1201   street were virtually cleaned off their foundations leaving only concrete slabs, which earned an F5
    1301   rating. Three other homes in this housing division also received F5 damage, with the remaining dest
    1401  ruction rated high F4. Three persons also died in the 600-unit Emerald Springs Apartments on Western
    1501   Ave. located across the street from Eastlake Estates. One 2-story apartment building on the north e
    1601  nd of the apartment complex was virtually flattened, and received an F5 rating. Westmoore High Schoo
    1701  l, located just north of Eastlake Estates, was also heavily damaged. Although a well-attended awards
    1801   ceremony was being held at the school during the tornado, no one was injured, however dozens of veh
    1901  icles in the school parking lot were either damaged or destroyed. F4 damage continued northeast into
    2001   another residential area east of Western Ave. and south of 119th St. The tornado then entered the w
    2101  estern city limits of Moore (Cleveland County) along Santa Fe and near NW 12th, and produced damage
    2201  between 1/2 and 3/4 of a mile wide. Maximum damage, rated high F4/low F5, extended northeast to near
    2301   Janeway with several large groups of homes flattened. Four persons died in this residential area. F
    2401  4 damage continued to South Shields just north of the junction with Interstate 35. A woman was also
    2501  killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass of Interstate 35. The tornado appeared
    2601   to weaken just slightly after crossing interstate 35, however it remained a formidable storm with w
    2701  idespread high F3/low F4 damage observed in Highland Park, a residential area, south of the First Ba
    2801  ptist Church on 27th St. in Moore. Escaping with relatively minor damage, and being located near the
    2901   halfway point of the tornado path, the First Baptist Church in Moore eventually served as the prima
    3001  ry coordination center for most tornado relief efforts. The tornado then continued northeast and ent

     701  ing through southeast Oklahoma City, another tornado (A11) touched down briefly about 1/2 mile south
     801   of Interstate 240 (Oklahoma County), near the intersection of SE 80th and Sooner Rd. Damage from to
     901  rnado A11, rated F0, included fences being blown down and minor roof damage inflicted to a couple of
    1001   houses. Tornado A9 then entered residential neighborhoods between SE 59th and SE 44th where 1 woman
    1101   was killed in her house. Crossing SE 44th into Del City (Oklahoma County) the tornado moved through
    1201   the highly populated Del Aire housing addition killing 6 persons and damaging or destroying hundred
    1301  s of homes, many with F3/F4 damage. The tornado then crossed Sooner Rd., damaged an entry gate and s
    1401  everal costly structures at Tinker Air Force Base, then crossed 29th St. into Midwest City (Oklahoma
    1501   County), destroying 1 building in the Boeing Complex and damaging 2 others. Widespread F3/F4 damage
    1601   continued as the tornado moved across Interstate 40 affecting a large business district. Approximat
    1701  ely 800 vehicles were damaged at Hudiburg Auto Group, located just south of Interstate 40. Hundreds
    1801  of the vehicles were moved from their original location, and dozens of vehicles were picked up and t
    1901  ossed northward across Interstate 40 into several motels, a distance of approximately 2 tenths of a
    2001  mile. Numerous motels and other businesses including Hampton Inn, Comfort Inn, Inn Suites, Clarion I
    2101  nn, Cracker Barrel, and portions of Rose State College, were destroyed. Some of the damage through t
    2201  his area was rated high F4, however low F5 was considered. The tornado then continued into another r
    2301  esidential area located between SE 15th and Reno Ave. where 3 fatalities occurred. High F4 damage wa
    2401  s inflicted to 4 homes in this area. Two of these homes were located between SE 12th and SE 11th, ne
    2501  ar Buena Vista, and the other 2 homes were located on Will Rogers Rd. just south of SE 15th. Damage
    2601  then diminished rapidly to F0/F1 as the tornado crossed Reno Ave. before dissipating 3 blocks north
    2701  of Reno Ave. between Sooner Rd. and Air Depot Blvd. 2751

468431    The 12th tornado, A12, formed about 3 miles southwest of Choctaw in Oklahoma County and produced F2
     101  damage to two homes and lesser damage to many others in the southwest part of Choctaw. The tornado m
     201  oved into the center of town where a car was thrown over the canopy at a drive-in-restaurant. The bu
     301  siness strip located on the north side of NE 23rd was especially affected with several businesses de
     401  stroyed, including Pizza Hut, Sonic, and Tri-City Youth and Family Shelter. Damage was mainly F1as i

     601  ontinued to weaken in rural areas and dissipated near the intersection of NE 50th and Triple XXX Roa
     701  d. In total, damage estimates are near 3.2 million dollars, with 8 businesses destroyed, 130 busines
     801  ses damaged, 14 homes destroyed, and 23 homes damaged. The 13th tornado, A13, formed about 4 miles e
     901  ast-southeast of Jones in Oklahoma County near the intersection of NE 63rd and Triple XXX Rd., and w
    1001  as captured on video. Only minor damage (F0), was observed as the tornado tracked northward along Tr

554712    Green Co: pre-dawn and morning urban/small stream flooding occurred countywide due to rainfall that
     101  started on May 31st.  The rains ended by sunrise.  Up to 5 inches of rain fell overnight in the sout
     201  hwest part of the county.  Many streams were 5 to 10 feet wide, resulting in water covering low-lyin
     301  g roads to a depth of 1 foot.  Several cars were swept into roadside ditches.  Urban basements had m
     401  inor flood damage.  Additional heavy rains followed the evening squall line which resulted in a new
     501  round of flash flooding across much of the county.  Eight miles of the 24 mile long Sugar River Stat
     601  e Trail were closed from near Monticello to near Albany due to washed out bridges and undercut paths
     701  .  Five homes sustained significant damage.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water levels and
     801   dozens of vehicles were stranded or pushed into roadside ditches.  Gravel road shoulder and culvert
     901   washouts were noted countywide.  Water levels in the city of Brodhead were the highest in many year
    1001  s.  Legion Park in Albany was closed after the adjacent Sugar River exceeded flood stage.  Moderate
    1101  to severe soil erosion was noted to 5000 acres of farm fields.  The Pecatonica River at Martintown e
    1201  xceeded the flood stage of 13.5 feet at 0000CST on June 1st, and crested at 18.51 feet on June 4th (
